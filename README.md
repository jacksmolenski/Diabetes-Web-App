# Diabetes-Web-App
Independent Learning Project 

My name is Jack Smolenski, and I am 21 years old (as of April 2024). This is a personal project. I am a type 1 diabetic and have been dianosed since I was 15 months old. Given my life with diabetes I would like to design a web application that could be of use to those who are struggling with diabetes.
